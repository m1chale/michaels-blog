            <p class="post-text"> Michael says: <q>Collaboration is very important.</q><br>Imagine the following
                situation. You are working on a large project together with many other employees. One day you find out
                that the application you are responsible for is no longer working. How can this be? You have not changed
                anything. After a long search and investigation, you find out that a colleague has made a change, but
                has not informed you about it. He received the instruction from the management. How could this happen?
                Why weren't you involved?</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="post-sub-heading">What Is Collaboration?</h2>

            <p class="post-text">Collaboration means working together with other employees from different departments to
                achieve a common goal. <u>There are different responsibilities and hierarchies among employees.</u>
                There are concepts and procedures that are accepted and lived by all. For example, a unified
                communication based on a communication plan.
