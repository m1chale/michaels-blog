            <p class="post-text"> Michael says: <q>Collaboration is very important.</q><br>Imagine you are responsible
                for customer service at a technology company. Fortunately, your company enjoys high customer
                satisfaction. Until one day it plummets. It turns out you've received a wave of complaints about a new
                software update. This is the first you've heard of such an update. You investigate and find that the
                various departments just aren't talking to each other. The IT department failed to inform you and the
                marketing department, so customers were neither informed nor warned. Worse, they failed to ask customers
                for feedback on what the update should include, and now they can't access some of the features they
                liked best.</p>

            <br>
            <h2 class="post-sub-heading">What Is Collaboration?</h2>

            <p class="post-text">Collaboration means working together with people from across the business to achieve
                a shared goal. Although similar to teamwork, a collaborative partnership is not hierarchicalâ€“
                <u>everyone has equal status,</u> no matter their seniority (though you may elect one person to organize
                the collaborative project). You can collaborate with members of your own team or from other departments,
                as well as contractors, clients, or even other organizations.
