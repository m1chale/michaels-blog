            <p class="postText">Imagine you are responsible for customer service at a technology company. Fortunately,
                your company enjoys high customer satisfaction. Until one day it plummets. It turns out you've received
                a wave of complaints about a new software update. This is the first you've heard of such an update. You
                investigate and find that the various departments just aren't talking to each other. The IT department
                failed to inform you and the marketing department, so customers were neither informed nor warned. Worse,
                they failed to ask customers for feedback on what the update should include, and now they can't access
                some of the features they liked best.</p>

            <h3 class="postSubHeading">What Is Collaboration?</h3>
            <p class="postText">Collaboration means working together with people from across the business to achieve a
                shared goal. Although similar to teamwork, a collaborative partnership is not hierarchical â€“ everyone
                has equal status, no matter their seniority (though you may elect one person to organize the
                collaborative project). You can collaborate with members of your own team or from other departments, as
                well as contractors, clients, or even other organizations.</p>
